# Outlier-Detector
This is an algorithm written with Python. The algorithm scans a dataset to detect outliers (extreme values), the dataset can either be univariate or multivariate and different outlier methods can be chosen based on the magnitude of the x variables. 

The following were then determined;
#1. Outliers and outliers percentage for each outlier method (Inter Quartile Range, ZScore, Local Outlier Factor)
#2. A line chart of monthly outlier rate is now plotted to show month-on-month detected outliers
#3. T Test differential between the monthly sample with and without outliers 
#4  
  a. Two sample T tests for the difference between the full and outlier less means for all segments.
  b. Two sample T tests for the difference between the full and outlier less means for all segmented distribution.
#5. A heat map comparing the p values of the difference in means for full and outlier less distributions
